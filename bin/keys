# ACTUAL SCRIPT

# pass-extension-tomb didn't play well with git.
# The ~/.password.tomb file was 10MB at start so
# pushing and pulling it around wasn't quite comfortable.
# Specially considering my biggest hand written file being
# 72 KB at time of writing.
# So I wrote this script to emulate the basic functions
# of 'pass tomb' so I can carry the encrypted
# ~/.password-store
# directory around without those 10MB that haunted me.
# Also, I am not acquainted with that LUKS encryption
# protocol (seems interesting though) while the 'gnupg'
# program has had a lot of publicity so this is a nice
# instance to get to know it better.

# PRIMITIVE LEVEL 1 functions affect the whole script.
# PRIMITIVE LEVEL 2 functions depend on PL1.
# WRAPS are simply to make the front end nicer to script.
# Do not make calls within functions of the same level
# since it can lead to inconsistencies.
# (maybe it's time to migrate to another more robust language?)

# BACK END

# PRIMITIVE LEVEL 1

# tar has issues when pointing paths _with_ slashes,
# says something like removing hard links or some sort.
# So to avoid that, it is _essential_ to be located in the $HOME
# directory so one can point tar the paths without slashes.
