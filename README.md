dotfiles and submodules

This is not planned to be viewed by anyone, but I need this repo to be public and also 
it doesn't hurt to have a "Hello" sign in my front door.

Hellow fellow human.

If you are reading this you probably know what you are looking for. If not: this 
repository is to store my dotfiles using a git bare-repo technique for tracking changes. 
See below for details. 

Currently I'm using this method to do the dotfiles tracking:

I discovered it on Derek's DistroTube Youtube Channel a couple of months ago:

Thanks Derek!

I thought about using GNU Stow, but Atlassian's seems simpler to use.

You can check the ``bin/home`` bash script and all the aliases regarding 'home' in ``.bash/aliases`` to get 
an idea of how to use them. It's everything written in Bash.

If you find this helpful, give me a million dollars - lol.

Enjoy.

Obviously I can't guarantee that any of this is secure, but I can tell you I use it every day
and the main source of problems is me when I screw things up; good thing we have git around to save us.

Happy hacking.
